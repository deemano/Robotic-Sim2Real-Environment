### GitHub Repository Description for the xARM-7 Simulation Project

**Project Title:** RobSim2Real

**Description:**

This project presents a comprehensive simulation platform developed to facilitate rapid prototyping, testing, and motion transfer between the virtual and physical xARM-7 robotic arm. Utilizing the PyBullet physics engine and the xARM SDK, the platform offers detailed and realistic digital representations of the xARM-7, enabling intuitive interaction and direct control through a user-friendly interface.

**Features:**

- **Realistic Physics Simulation:** Powered by PyBullet, the environment accurately models the dynamics of the xARM-7, including rigid and soft body interactions, for precise motion replication.
- **Intuitive Control System:** Users can manipulate the robotic arm in the simulation using mouse inputs or sliders for joint control, offering a seamless transition between manual adjustments and automated control mechanisms.
- **Pose Recording and Playback:** This feature allows the capture and playback of specific arm poses, facilitating the demonstration of complex tasks and the validation of control strategies.
- **Synthetic Data Generation:** The platform can generate synthetic images from the simulation's camera view, useful for computer vision applications or debugging purposes.
- **Safety Features:** Incorporates safety protocols such as self-collision detection and error handling to ensure a smooth transition from simulation to real-world application.

**Light Version Distribution:**

Accompanying this repository, we provide a light version of the simulation environment as part of the project report. This version focuses on the simulation aspects without requiring a connection to the physical robotic arm, making it suitable for broader educational and research purposes.

**Fully Developed Version for Internal Use:**

The complete version of the xARM-7 Simulation Environment, which includes features for direct interaction with the physical xARM-7 robotic arm, is documented in this GitHub repository. Due to the proprietary nature of certain components access to the full version is restricted for internal use.

**Contributions and Feedback:**

We welcome contributions and feedback from the community to improve the simulation environment further. If you have suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
